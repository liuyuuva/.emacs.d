* Education Background
** Education: Start of the Journey in  Control Engineering
*** B.S. in /Automation/, 2001
- Curriculum focused on automatic control
- Core courses: control, signal and system, sensors, actuators,  etc.
*** M.S. in /Control Science and Engineernig/, 2004
- Further study in control theory and engineering
- /A glimpse at real-world control systems/

** PhD: A Deeper Dive Into Control Research
*** A thorough exposure to control study
- Full spectrum of dynamics and control courses
- Adaptive control, optimal control, robust control,
  nonlinear systems, dynamical systems

*** A start in control research training
- Modeling of dynamical systems under failures and damage
- Multivariable adaptive control algorithms for
  aircraft under actuator failures and airframe damage

* Training in Control Research
** Postdoctoral Research: Farewell to Academia
*** Continued research in adaptive control
- Worked with engineers from NASA Langley Research Center to evaluate
  adaptive control for aircraft appliations
- Designed adaptive algorithms for aircraft under variable failures
- Simulation of aircraft systems using NASA UAV Model
- Invented adaptive control allocation algorithm
*** Decided to bid farewell to academia
- Huge gap between control theory and applications
- Personally prefer the practical side
